                <h2>Our Youth & Technology</h2>
                <p>One of the key experiences recommended during your time as an undergraduate is doing an internship. Gaining work experience is key for boosting your employability, especially as a business student. That’s why, after my second year at Hult, I chose to go back home to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to intern for a part of the summer.

                    I undertook a six-week internship at a local bank, called Rawbank. I was one of about thirty university-level interns—what they referred to as “academic interns.” Myself and my fellow academic interns were not there in the hopes of getting a job with the bank later, but rather we were there to learn and understand the inner functioning of a bank.
                    
                    Rawbank is one of the biggest commercial banks in the country, with multiple big clients. So the first thing we had to do was sign non-disclosure agreements to make sure that the privacy and anonymity of their clients were maintained. After that, we were assigned a supervisor. We were expected to report back to our supervisor at the end of each week</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the start of each week, we were sent to a new department where we were briefed and given a person to shadow. During the shadowing, we mostly took notes and were given small tasks or errands to run..</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks to the classes I had already taken at Hult, after two weeks I was assigned to a “permanent” position at the front office of the bank, where I dealt with small daily operations such as check deposits, withdrawal slips and such.</p>
